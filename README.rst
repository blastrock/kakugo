One of the biggest difficulty with learning Japanese is memorizing kanji and vocabulary. While learning them by just reading and writing them everyday may work, the more kanji you know, the harder it gets and the more time it takes to revise them all. Proper tools can help you memorize these huge amounts of knowledge to more quickly become a fluent Japanese speaker.

Kakugo is one of these tools. It helps learning and revising kanji and vocabulary in an efficient manner. It uses Spaced Repetition in a unique way that adapts to the user's pace. If you only have time to revise 30 kanji every day, or if you can revise as much as 100 kanji every day, Kakugo will adapt and test you on the right kanji at the right time for you to memorize them. There is no "kanji of the day" list to revise, you can start and finish a session whenever you feel like it.

Kakugo also features a wide variety of tests to help you find the best ways that will help you learn Japanese.
